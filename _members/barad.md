Ben is a structural biologist with a special interest in emerging computational and experimental methods in electron microscopy. In January 2024, he founded the Barad lab at [Oregon Health & Science University](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/chemical-physiology-and-biochemistry) in Portland, OR. His long term goal is to build workflows that unify and contextualize protein structure and cellular ultrastructure into a multi-scale understanding of cellular function and regulation.


He completed my undergraduate degree in Biological Chemistry at Stanford University, where he worked with [Elizabeth Sattely](http://www.stanford.edu/group/sattelygroup/cgi-bin/wordpress/) investigating bacterial degradation of the plant polymer lignin. While there, he grew to love the collective regulation of large-scale ultrastructural features of organisms (such as the plant cell wall) by individual enzymes. This is a passion that has continue to fuel his scientific path to this day. 


He received his PhD in biophysics from UCSF in the lab of [James Fraser](http://fraserlab.com), where he developed methods for the [building](https://elifesciences.org/articles/17219) and [validating atomic models](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3541) generated from single particle electron microscopy. He also developed [novel computational analysis tools for time-resolved x-ray scattering experiments](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-019-0329-3) and investigated the [mechanisms of activity of mammalian chitinases](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.3822).  


Previous to starting the Barad lab, he worked as a postdoc with [Danielle Grotjahn](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/grotjahn/), using cryo-electron tomography of focused ion beam-thinned cells to quantify mitochondrial morphology and solve _in situ_ protein structures. While there, he developed the [Surface Morphometrics Pipeline](https://github.com/GrotjahnLab/surface_morphometrics), the ongoing development of which continues in the Barad lab. He also developed automation advances that allowed the collection and processing of hundreds of tilt series, and used these advances to study changes to the architecture and regulation of mitochondrial fission in response to varied chemical and genetic perturbations. Some of that work is ongoing! 


Beyond his scientific interests, Ben is excited about food and cooking, coffee, 3D printing, and games.
