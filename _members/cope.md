Jessica's focus is on the cellular rearrangements undergone by mammalian cells following bacterial infection using cryo-electron tomography. She graduated UC Berkeley in 2024 where she studied Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology and did her undergraduate research in the polyubiquitination mechanism of the membrane embedded Pex2-10-12 E3 ligase, a protein complex involed in peroxisomal targeted protein import.
