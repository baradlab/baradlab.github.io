Jessica uses cryo-electron tomography to explore the cellular membrane rearrangements undergone by mammalian cells following bacterial infection. She graduated UC Berkeley in 2024 where she studied Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology and did her undergraduate research in the structure and polyubiquitination mechanism of the membrane embedded Pex2-10-12 E3 ligase, a protein complex involved in peroxisomal targeted protein import.
