I am so excited to share the official opening of the Barad lab at [OHSU](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/chemical-physiology-and-biochemistry). We're slowly buying equipment and [hiring people](/join) and are so excited to interact with the rest of the scientific community at OHSU and around the world.

Our lab will start out focused on two things:
1. Understanding how intracellular bacteria manipulate mammalian cells as part of their lifecycles.
2. Developing methods to better connect quantitative cellular ultrastructure with protein structure and localization through cryoelectron tomography.

We welcome collaborations beyond these initial starting points and especially love to help adapt our methods to solve challenging problems in structural and ultrastructural biology. Our methods will always be available open source on our [Github](https://github.com/baradlab) and we are happy to welcome outside feedback and contribution, up to and including contributions that merit authorship in the papers describing our work.
