# Abstract:
Advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
require the development of validation metrics to independently
assess map quality and model geometry. We report EMRinger,
a tool that assesses the precise fitting of an atomic model into
the map during refinement and shows how radiation damage
alters scattering from negatively charged amino acids. EMRinger
(https://github.com/fraser-lab/EMRinger) will be useful for
monitoring progress in resolving and modeling high-resolution
features in cryo-EM.

# Commentary from the first author:
My first paper! This really ignited my love for model-based analysis as well as giving me my first taste of scientific programming. 
While most projects in the Barad lab do not involve detailed atomic modeling, 
the principles of using modeling to incorporate priors to overcome the complexity of experimental density remain valuable at the cell-scale!
