Our lab welcomes applicants from any race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, caregiver and family commitments, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and eligible age or disability status. Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a supportive and collaborative lab environment.

We are always in the market for motivated and talented people, even if we do not have an open position currently advertised. We are interested in engaging with you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of computational and experimental techniques. If interested please send your CV/Resume to [Dr. Benjamin Barad](/contact). Because we believe in fair compensation for people's work, we do not accept volunteer positions in the lab.

### Currrently, we have the following open positions available:
* [Research Assistant](https://externalcareers-ohsu.icims.com/jobs/27806/research-assistant-2/job) to help establish sample preparation protocols for studying early bacterial infection by cryoET.
* [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://postdoctoral-ohsu.icims.com/jobs/27805/postdoctoral-scholar/job) to lead projects focused on cytoskeletal reorganization during intracellular bacterial infection.
* [Summer Undergraduate Intern](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/chemical-physiology-and-biochemistry/chemical-physiology-and-biochemistry-summer) to assist with sample preparation and tomographic data processing, segmentation, and quantification.

## Graduate Students

Graduate students are recommended apply to a [degree program](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/graduate-studies/degree-programs) at OHSU. The Barad lab primarily participates in the [Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/biomedical-sciences-graduate-program), and may affiliate with other programs in the future.

Once admitted, students rotate between three labs in their winter quarter prior to deciding on a thesis lab. The Barad lab is generally open to rotation students every quarter so long as there is funding available for them to join the lab should they choose to do so. We generally limit to one rotation student per rotation window, so please reach out to [Dr. Barad](/contact) early to simplify scheduling of rotations.

As the 3rd rotation period comes to a close, we will talk with the year's rotation students (at least those who remain interested!) about joining the lab.  During this period, we encourage students to keep talking to the PI and lab members about what kind of project they might want to shape. We consider project fit, scientific chemistry, and alignment with lab values. To ensure all rotation students are given consideration, we cannot make final commitments.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to [Dr. Benjamin Barad](/contact). We encourage candidates to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research, and are open to potential joint postdoc opportunities if there is strong potential for collaboration with another lab at OHSU.

## Postbaccalaureate Researchers

The lab welcomes postbaccalaureate researchers to join the lab as Research Assistants and in the future may participate in formal training programs such as [OHSU-PREP](https://www.ohsu.edu/postbaccalaureate-research-education-program). We strive to provide training to help prepare our lab members for their chosen career path, be it graduate research, medical school, or otherwise.

## Undergraduate Researchers

We participate in the [Chemical Physiology and Biochemistry Summer Undergraduate Research Program (CPB-SURP)](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/chemical-physiology-and-biochemistry/chemical-physiology-and-biochemistry-summer). We are happy to welcome students to continue to work in the laboratory after the conclusion of this program as undergraduate researchers. Local Portland students interested in working in the lab during the school year are welcome to join through internship programs for credit or as paid undergraduate researchers, though we find that such experiences are most productive with at least half-time (20 hour per week) commitment.

## Other visitors

We would love to host foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, and any other interested visitors to the lab. Our only limitation is generally that we want visitors to be compensated either by their home institution or by us.
